title: "qualle (a framework to predict the quality of a multi-label classification result)"
abstract: "This framework allows to train a model which can be used to predict the quality of the result of applying a multi-label classification (MLC) method on a document. In this implementation, only the recall is predicted for a document, but in principle any document-level quality estimation (such as the prediction of precision) can be implemented analogously."
